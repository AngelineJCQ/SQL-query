# SQL-query
 
Use SQL query in a jupyter notebook!

The table I used can be found on [UN Data](http://data.un.org/Explorer.aspx). Or you can just click the link and download the file
- [undata_solar_2021.csv]()
- [undata_wind_2021.csv]()
- [undata_fallingwater_2021.csv]()

A very useful instruction provided by [Jon Thirkield](https://github.com/jthirkield) of creating a database in Postgres can be found [here](http://floatingmedia.com/columbia/csv_to_sql.html).

The code includes:
- connect to the database
- simple SQL query
- aggregate query
- join two tables
- join with aggregates
- filter by conditions
- build a basic timeseries
